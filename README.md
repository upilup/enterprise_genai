## ❓ Problem Statement
The rapid adoption of **Generative AI (GenAI)** across industries raises questions about its actual impact on employees, including:  
- Training hours invested  
- New AI-driven roles created  
- Number of employees impacted  
- Changes in productivity  

Using the **SMART Framework**, this project aims to:  
- **Specific**: Identify trends in GenAI adoption and workforce transformation.  
- **Measurable**: Track productivity changes with a target of at least **10% improvement** (2022–2024).  
- **Achievable**: Apply EDA on a comprehensive dataset.  
- **Relevant**: Provide insights for **AI-aligned workforce strategies**.  
- **Time-Bound**: Project workforce impact through **2025**.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name**: Enterprise GenAI Adoption & Workforce Impact Data  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tfisthis/enterprise-genai-adoption-and-workforce-impact-data)  
- **Content**:  
  - Adoption year (2022–2024)  
  - Industry sector  
  - GenAI training provided & training hours  
  - New AI-driven roles created  
  - Employees impacted  
  - Productivity change indicators  
  - GenAI tools used  

---

## 🔍 Key Questions
- What are the **trends in GenAI adoption** (2022–2024)?  
- How does **training hours** correlate with new roles and employee impact?  
- Which industries saw the **highest productivity gains**?  
- Which countries experienced the **largest workforce impact**?  
- What are the **most adopted GenAI tools**, and how has this evolved?  
- Can we **project productivity trends for 2025**?  

---

## 📊 Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Correlation Analysis** (training hours ↔ new roles ↔ productivity)  
- **Trend Analysis** (2022–2024)  
- **Linear Regression Projection** (2025)  

---

## ✅ Findings
- GenAI adoption grew consistently across industries from **2022–2024**.  
- Training programs and new roles increased steadily, but **productivity remained flat**:  
  - 2022: **18.52%**  
  - 2023: ~**18.42–18.44%**  
  - 2024: ~**18.44–18.46%**  
- Projection for 2025: **18.39%** → slight decline.  
- Insight: Organizations are **adopting GenAI**, but without **strategic integration**, productivity gains may **plateau**.  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
While GenAI adoption continues to expand, **measurable productivity gains are stagnating**.  
- The key challenge is not adoption, but **effective integration into workflows**.  
- To unlock GenAI’s full potential, companies must focus on **employee enablement** and **strategic usage** rather than adoption alone.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn (for projection analysis)  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Expand analysis to include **region-based adoption**.  
- Apply **predictive modeling** beyond linear regression.  
- Explore **causal inference** to better map GenAI’s role in productivity.
